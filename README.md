Very Good Coffee App lets you visualize random coffee photos on a beautiful
interface and save the ones you like. The app pulls the coffee photos from the
free API [https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev](https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev) and
the favorited photos are stored on the device using a local SQLite database.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To run the app, either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or
use the command:

```sh
$ flutter run --target lib/main.dart
```

_\*Very Good Coffee App was developed to run on iOS and Android only._

## Implementation details üõ†Ô∏è

Although `very_good_cli` generates 3 flavors by default (development, staging,
production), because of its simplicity and the use of a simple API that doesn't
require environment configurations, this project has only one flavor.

The API is consumed using the [http][http_link] package via a custom
`ApiService` class. This class is extended by the `CoffeeApiService` class,
which exposes a `getRandom` method to fetch a random coffee photo.

`DatabaseService` uses the [floor][floor_link] package to interact with the
local SQLite database. It relies on the `CoffeeDao` class, that defines the
database operations related to coffee photos.

Database operations are managed by the `FavoritesRepository`, which provides
`addFavorite`, `getFavorite` and `getFavorites` methods. Another repository,
`CoffeeRepository`, provides the `getRandom` method to fetch a random coffee
photo from the API.

State management is provided by the BLoC pattern, with `HomeBloc` and
`FavoritesBloc` classes. These classes provide business logic for the three main
screens in the app: `HomeScreen`, `FavoritesScreen` and `FavoriteDetailsScreen`.
The `HomeScreen` displays a random coffee photo and allows the user to save it
to the favorites list. The `FavoritesScreen` displays the list of favorited
photos stored in the local database. Finally, the `FavoriteDetailsScreen`
displays the full-size version of a favorited coffee photo.

## Tests üß™

To run all tests, a utility script is provided:

```sh
$ ./run_tests
```

It runs the `very_good test` command, alongside with
[lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate a coverage
report. To visualize the coverage report, open the generated `index.html` file
in the `coverage` directory.
